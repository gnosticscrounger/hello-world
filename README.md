# Hello World

Hi, I had created an account on this site a few months earlier for a now abandoned website project.
My motivation for returning is that I've now become serious about persuing linux and need a better way to manage my frequent dotfile edits. This little pseudo-repository is just to complete the introductory tutorial to learn how to use this site and hopefully git in general.
